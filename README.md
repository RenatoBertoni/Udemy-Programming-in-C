# Class Code from the course Programming in C - The Complete Course
Instructor: Anand Mahajan. (https://www.udemy.com/course/programming-in-c-the-complete-course/)


These are codes/notes created during the lectures, code provided and instructions given, and thus are based thereon.

Each folder relates to each module. And each file is named according the order in which I saw fit to create it, and not necessarily the order of its subject in the lectures.
